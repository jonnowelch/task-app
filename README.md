Thank you for viewing my react to do app.

This is the first web app I have made using React Context, React Hooks and Reducers.

The app uses local storage so you can store things in and come back to them later. It is also hosted live at: https://jw-task.netlify.com

The code is all available to see here, to clone into your terminal please use https://github.com/jonnowelch/task-app.git

From there into your terminal type: 'npm start' to run in your localhost.
