Thank you for viewing my react to do app.

This is the first web app I have made using React Context, React Hooks and Reducers.

I am going to be adding local storage capabilities next and then hosting it online too.

The code is all available to see here, to clone into your terminal please use https://github.com/jonnowelch/task-app.git

From there into your terminal type: 'npm start' to run in your localhost.
